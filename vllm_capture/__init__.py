vLLM Activation Capture System

Hook-free activation capture designed to work with vLLMâ€™s runner layer
using an intermediate_tensors integration. Captures ALL tokens (prefill
and decode) and supports fast, practical compression modes.

Key Properties:
- No PyTorch forward hooks (CUDA graphs can remain enabled)
- All tokens captured via runner-level integration
- Compression modes: random projection + uint8, full uint8, or top-k sparse
